### Exercises 1.1-1
***
Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that re-
quires computing a convex hull.

### `Answer`

* Everytime we arrange something ,we use various type of sorting algorithm unknowingly . From sorting of Alphabets to arranging vegitables by their size .

* For knowing the uses of convex hull ,we must try to understand what is a convex hull .Here is description at wikipedia .
  This image quite clear what is convex hull .

  Two of uses that comes to my mind are :
  1. Robot Motion Planning 

  In order to get from s to t, the shortest path will either be the straight line from s to t (if the obstacle doesn't intersect it) or one of the two polygonal chains of the convex hull.

  2 . Use in image processing and pattern recognition .Here is the example that given in opencv documentaion(image processing library) . 
  The figure below displays convexity defects of a hand contour:

### Exercises 1.1-2
***
Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world
setting?
  
### `Answer`

* Other than speed : 'Complexity' , 'Memory requirement' ,'Optimal method'  used is pretty used for efficiency .


### Exercises 1.1-3
***
Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and
limitations.

### `Answer`

I used array very often . 
* Strength : 
	1 . It is used to represent multiple data items of same type by using only single name.
	2 .	It can be used to implement other data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs etc.
	3 .	Easy to represent and understand .

* Limitation:

	1 .	It is static ,so it is fixed in size , It means memory allocated to array can't be reduced or increased .
	2 .	Searching and sorting is difficult and time consuming .  
	

### Exercises 1.1-4
***

How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar?
How are they different?	

### `Answer`

* In both of problems we want that "lowest overall distance " travelled .
* The TSP solution requires its answer to be a cycle.However a shortest path will not (unless one is looking for shortest path 	  from a node to itself).
* TSP is an NP-complete problem and shortest path is known polynomial-time.

### Exercises 1.1-5
***
Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then
come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good
enough.

### `Answer`

* Sorting of a list (only the best solution will do, nearly sorted is not acceptable) .
* Finding the path between two points. (no matter what solution you used ,you still reach the point .So doesn'y matter)
