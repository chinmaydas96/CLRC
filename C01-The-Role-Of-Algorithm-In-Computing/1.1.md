### Exercises 1.1-1
***
Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that re-
quires computing a convex hull.

### `Answer`

* Everytime we arrange something ,we use various type of sorting algorithm unknowingly . From sorting of Alphabets to arranging vegitables by their size .

* For knowing the uses of convex hull ,we must try to understand what is a convex hull .Here is description at wikipedia .
  This image quite clear what is convex hull .

  Two of uses that comes to my mind are 
  1 . Robot Motion Planning 

  In order to get from s to t, the shortest path will either be the straight line from s to t (if the obstacle doesn't intersect it) or one of the two polygonal chains of the convex hull.

  2 . Use in image processing and pattern recognition .Here is the example that given in opencv documentaion(image processing library) . 
  The figure below displays convexity defects of a hand contour:
